# Alyssa Natividad - Portfolio

## Description

A portfolio of work can showcase your skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights your strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it.

This portfolio contains three sections:

- About Me/Hello! section, that includes the developer's name, an avatar, and a small description about the developer
- Projects section, each image is a link to a previous work done by the developer. Each project is a card that can be clicked and when clicked, a description of the project and links to the deployed project and github repository is found. And,
- Contact Me section that lists the ways the developer could be contacted along with their LinkedIn and Github accounts.

This web application is made using HTML, CSS framework called [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/), and JavaSwcript.
